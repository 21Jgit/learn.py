# Starting with this line, we learn our first bit of syntax... well not really. Anything on a line after a # will not be ran.

Same for anything between to sets of three "
So none of this here is read.
This one here is for multiline comments, unlike #, which only does one line

# This file when ran shouldn't encounter any errors if you run it in using python 3.8 or above, I'm no expert on the earlier versions.
# The rest of this file will be in comments so nothing is ran, other files as I make them will have run-able code, I will go over that in the next file.
# Now, onto the actual Syntax.

"""
In Python, we don't need ; at the end of every line, this can be helpful because it saves that poor semi-colon which has been hit more times than the w, a, s, and d keys.
Now, imagine a box with a cat in it. Let's say the cats name is "Cat", what if we also called the box "Box"?
Well? Now we have "Cat" in Box. What is the box was "Cat" itself?
Well... Box = "Cat"
Congrats, we now know variables... kinda. That example was bad... Let me explain.
Box is now like something we can talk about all the time, we ask python "Hey... What is Box?" And Python will cay "Cat". That's a very simple version of what is happening here.
I'll go more in depth on this in the Output lesson and Input lesson.

# Note from me... This file is kinda useless exept teaching about how to do comments... So... Feel free to ignore it haha
